### Hey, I'm Aalap ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer and 3rd year CS student at UT Austin. I enjoy creating software solutions whenever I notice a problem or inconvenience, and I'm currently a technical project manager at [UT's IEEE CS](http://ieeecs.ece.utexas.edu/projects) chapter where I lead teams of engineers in doing the same. I've also worked as a software engineer intern at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) and [Olympus](https://www.olympusamerica.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, reading about finance, photography, and traveling.
